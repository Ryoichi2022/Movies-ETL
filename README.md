# Movies-ETL

### Description of the Project
The purpose of the project is to create an automated pipeline for the ETL process of the dataset. Three types of files are provided including ‘movies_metadata’ and ‘ratings’ in csv format as well as ‘wikipedia-movies’ in json format. From these files, the necessary data is extracted and transformed to generate a nice, clean data, which will be then loaded into a SQL database for analysts’ use.
